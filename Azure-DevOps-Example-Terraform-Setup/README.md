## Setting up Azure DevOps to begin deploying Terraform and configuring an Azure Storage Account for Terraform remote state

Within this blog post I am going to show how to setup Azure DevOps and configuring an Azure Storage Account for Terraform remote state. I write numerous blog posts that do reference this scenario quite often; rather than repeating myself within each post I am creating this base post of which I will be referencing in any future blog posts that use this setup.

### Purpose
This repository contains code that sets up Azure DevOps for deploying Terraform and configures an Azure Storage Account for Terraform remote state. This setup is a common requirement in many Terraform deployments, and this repository provides a reusable solution.

### Usage
To use this code, clone the repository and follow the instructions in the blog post. The instructions will guide you through setting up Azure DevOps and configuring an Azure Storage Account for Terraform remote state.

### Prerequisites/Dependencies
You will need an Azure account and Azure DevOps. You will also need Terraform installed.
