## Deploying Terraform from develop to production consecutively using Azure DevOps

In this blog post, I am going to be diving further into deploying Azure Resources with Terraform using Azure DevOps with a CI/CD perspective in mind. I am going to show how you can deploy a develop & production terraform environment consecutively using Azure DevOps pipelines and showing how this is done by using pipeline triggers to allow you to create these environments consecutively starting from a pull request into develop .

### Purpose
This repository contains code that demonstrates how to deploy Terraform from a develop environment to a production environment consecutively using Azure DevOps. This setup is useful for implementing a CI/CD pipeline for Terraform deployments.

### Usage
To use this code, clone the repository and follow the instructions in the blog post. The instructions will guide you through setting up Azure DevOps and configuring pipeline triggers to deploy Terraform from develop to production consecutively.

### Prerequisites/Dependencies
You will need an Azure account and Azure DevOps. You will also need Terraform installed.
